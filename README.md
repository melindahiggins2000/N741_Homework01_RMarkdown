NRSG 741 - Homework 01 - Getting started with RMarkdown

1. Change the title of the report
2. Change the author of the report to your name
3. Add an additional sentence or two in the `"Specific statistics within text"` section that embeds the numeric result for the median height, standard deviation of the heights plus the minimum and maximum heights.
    - _HINT: the functions you will need are `median()`, `sd()`, `min()` and `max()`._
4. Add a section that also displays a histogram of the number of rings for the abalones. Add a few sentences about this distribution - what do you observe?
5. Add a section with another scatterplot of the `wholeWeight` (plotted on the y-axis) against the `shuckedWeight` (plotted on the x-axis). Color the points by `sex`. Add a sentence or two on what you see? Does anything seem off or unusual?
6. `knit` your report to HTML or DOC format and then save as a PDF to turn in on Canvas. 
    - Optional - you may also `knit` directly to PDF if you wish to install an optional `latex` package such as `MikTex` or `MacTex` or install the `tinytex` `R` package. Learn more at [https://yihui.name/tinytex/](https://yihui.name/tinytex/).

NOTE: You should have 8 sections in your final updated report for Homework 01.
